Gender Equality in Primary and Secondary Education--Project for STAT 613

When we talk about gender equality, we always pay attention to college admissions, employee ratios, equal pay for equal work, or glass ceilings. These are important, of course.
It's just one day one question hints me: if a country owns a low ratio on its primary and secondary education, how could it be possible to have a high ratio on college education? 
Basically the ratio of primary and secondary education influences the ratio of college and employees, then leadership and political participation as well. 

All data are from worldbank. Download links are within rmd file. 

This project presents: eda(Exploratory data analysis), download data using urls directly and delete temporary files ultimately, tidy all data by writting a function, build models for all countries separately at one time(just nest), and then unnest models to analyze them specifically. 

Methods: linear model and cluster.
